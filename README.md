# Shopping-Cart

## Description
In this project we created an API of products in a store through Strapi. The products are apples, oranges, beans, and cabbage. They each have an inital stock that can be picked from by the user. Once a product is picked by a user the stock decreases as it is added to the users cart. The user can then add more products to the cart, or delete what is in the cart. Finally once they are done they can restock the products by clicking the restock button. This pings our API and request the information to be replenished and filled with the new products.

## Future Improvements
Update the form and style
Update the look of the cart and allow for a more efficient deletion of the products. Instead of a product name in the cart the amount of times chosen it will just add a number of the amount next to the name
Allow for an actual chekout
More products
